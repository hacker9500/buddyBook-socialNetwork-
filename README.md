# buddyBook-socialNetwork-

I was trying to implement a socialNetwork using MEAN stack with socket.io
the front end and routing are not that good as i was trying to implementation for my own not
a professional project
This repo can help others to have the Idea of how mean stack works routing and all
there is a small bug in chat window although data is sent and received in realtime but we have to
press a key in input text to refresh the model(MVC) i'll debug it later: *i am lazy :P*

MEAN stack
M -> MongoDB(mongoose is used)
E -> ExpressJS
A -> AngularJS
N -> NodeJS
+
Socket.io to make chat real-time
